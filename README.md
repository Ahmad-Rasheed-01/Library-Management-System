## Abstract
This project is basically creating a database management system for the management of physical and online library. Aim of the project is to creating a backend program of 
the processes taking place using SQL. This model deals with the relationship between the books, borrower and borrowing details. The other entities play a supportive weak 
role. So basically this helps the librarian to keep a record of books, borrowers along with their details.
